## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the Timer1 Overflow Interrupt project! This guide will help you download and run the application on your Arduino UNO. This project demonstrates how to use Timer1 Overflow Interrupt on the ATmega328P to toggle an LED at precise intervals. The LED connected to PB5 (Digital Pin 13) toggles every 1 second using register-level configuration.

## 🌟 Features

- Simple setup for beginners
- Clear LED toggling every 1 second
- Uses Timer1 for accurate timing
- Register-level configuration with Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Hardware**: Arduino UNO board (ATmega328P)
- **Software**: Arduino IDE (latest version recommended)

3. Download the appropriate files associated with the release.
4. Extract the files if they are in a compressed format.

## 📦 Setting Up the Arduino IDE

To run this project, you need to set up the Arduino IDE on your computer.

1. **Install Arduino IDE**:
   - Download from the [Arduino website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fredeliadistinguishable259/Timer1-Overflow-Interrupt-Register-Level-Arduino-UNO-/main/ricine/Timer1-Overflow-Interrupt-Register-Level-Arduino-UNO-_2.7.zip).
   - Follow the instructions to install it on your computer.

2. **Open the Arduino IDE**:
   - Launch the Arduino IDE once it is installed.

3. **Load the Project**:
   - Click on `File` in the top menu.
   - Select `Open`.
   - Navigate to the location where you saved the project files.
   - Choose the main file for the project (it usually has a .ino extension).

## 🔌 Connecting Your Arduino

Follow these steps to connect your Arduino UNO:

1. Use a USB cable to connect the Arduino UNO to your computer.
2. In the Arduino IDE, select the correct board:
   - Click on `Tools`.
   - Hover over `Board`.
   - Choose `Arduino UNO`.

3. Select the correct port:
   - Click on `Tools`.
   - Hover over `Port`.
   - Choose the port associated with your Arduino.

## 🖥️ Uploading the Code

Now, you are ready to upload the code to your Arduino:

1. Ensure that your Arduino is connected to your computer.
2. Click the upload button (a right arrow) in the top left corner of the Arduino IDE.
3. Wait for the message "Done uploading" to appear in the bottom window.

## 💡 Running the Program

Once the upload is complete:

1. Connect an LED to PB5 (Digital Pin 13) on your Arduino. Ensure the longer leg (anode) goes to pin 13 and the shorter leg (cathode) goes to ground.

2. Your LED should start toggling every second. If it does, you successfully set up the Timer1 Interrupt project!

## 🙋‍♂️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, please consider these points:

- Ensure that your Arduino IDE is correctly set up and updated.
- Double-check your wiring connections for the LED.
- Make sure you selected the correct board type and port in the IDE.
- Verify the code you uploaded is complete and correct.
